## Hi my name is Mathieu Antunes 👋

- 🌍 I'm currently based in Toulouse
- 🚀 I'm a student of [Bachelor in Computer Science specialized in cyber security](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/but-specialite-informatique) at Université III Paul Sabatier
- ✉️ You can contact me at [mathieu.antunes31@gmail.com](mailto:mathieu.antunes31@gmail.com) or [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ANTUNESMathieu/)
- 👨‍💻 I'm actually working on a video game, and an app to transfer files from android to windows in electron/node.js



## My works

- 📲 [An electron/node.js application](https://github.com/Malachite01/appTransfertMobile) made to automatically transfer all pictures from an android phone to a computer. It's goal is to simplify the process of making regular local saves.  

- 📡 [A ftp-proxy](https://github.com/Malachite01/proxy-ftp) made in C. It is compatible with commands such as pwd, cd, ls, get, ...

- 🎮 An adventure video game **(⚠️WIP)** developed in Unity in C#. This project is a big one for me, and is really time consuming I'm currently working on it but i'll keep the repository private.

- 🪙 [A token economy web application](https://github.com/Malachite01/SAE-Trisomie21-HG) **(⚠️WIP)** made for the association "[trisomie 21 Haute-Garonne](http://trisomie21-haute-garonne.org/)" to help autistic and trisomic children (definition of token economy [here](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/token-economy)).

- 💻 [A web-documentary](https://webdoc-wejustwork.netlify.app/) about "crunch" in the video game industry, where I developed the website in its entirety. There is also a small video-game at the bottom of the website, that one of my team mates did, and where I did a lot of the assets.

- 🐠 [A small batch script](https://github.com/Malachite01/subnauticaSaves) to sync the saves of the game subnautica. This tool can be modified to sync folders.

- 🏐 [A volleyball management web application](https://github.com/Malachite01/miniProjetphp) made principally in php.

- 🧮 [A sudoku solver](https://github.com/Malachite01/sudokuSolver) coded in ADA. It was one of my first complicated study project that I did during my first year of Bachelor.
