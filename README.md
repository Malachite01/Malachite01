- 🎮 An adventure video game **(⚠️WIP)** developed in Unity in C#. This project is a big one for me, and is really time consuming I'm currently working on it but i'll keep the repository private.

- 📨 [A simple client-server communication project](https://github.com/Malachite01/tsock-Insa) made in C, implementing basic client-server model using TCP and UDP(to show data loss). It includes socket creation, message construction, error handling.

There is also a small video-game at the bottom of the website, that one of my team mates did, and where I did a lot of the assets.

- 🐠 [A small batch script](https://github.com/Malachite01/subnauticaSaves) to sync the saves of the game subnautica. This tool can be modified to sync folders.
